//search for exact match of performance title in methods, variations, unmethods

//any titles that should be checked further even if there's an exact match??

//******* if no match *******

//divide title, titleExtra, details into words + "punctuation" <--do I need to separate symbols if I'm using shoetest??

//classify each "word" in the title--words can have more than one category

//need to somehow filter out nonmethods (rounds, call changes) and Devon stuff here

//find any stage names and get methods at those stages, or check last bell and get methods at that stage and below

//build list of words in those method names and how many methods/variations/unmethods they're in

//look for words not in preliminary categories and in only one method name, then see how much of that method title can be found

//maybe I need to just go through the title and detail words, identify all that can be in a method name, then filter my methods based on whether they include any of those words in their name, then search for those method titles specifically. The problem is when the performance has words that *aren't* in any method name but are supposed to be.
